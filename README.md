# CodeChallenge1

These are my solutions to some of the challenges for the Code Challenge 1 of 2021 (the sucessor of Tuenti Challenge).

I solved the problems 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17. I used Python to solve all of them. I have included other challenges that I finished when the contest was over.

I reached the position 33 and I was given a T-shirt. Nice!

The information about the challenges can be found in this link and the problems will be available until next year.
