# To download the problem file, I needed a user and password. The hint was:
# "plyba:xvyy_nyy_uhznaf"

# Searching, I found a 2003 post with the word "plyba". It was about Battlestar Galactica
# https://chile.rec.cf.narkive.com/BUlCNqn4/galactica-2003
# So I discovered that they used rot13 to avoid spoilers
# I used an online tool to decode the hint
# https://rot13.com/
# "cylon:kill_all_humans"

# That was user and password so I could download the problem file.

# The file was the output of a file analyser, so recomposed the original file.

# Then, I used an online analyser to know the extension of the file
# https://asecuritysite.com/forensics/file

# It was gzip, so I knew how to read it. I extract the content using gzip library

# Then, I have to examinate the file. It contains a fragment from 'Lord of the Rings'
# But if we look closely enough, we can see some strange symbols
# [b'\xe2\x80\x8b', b'\xe2\x80\x8c', b'\xe2\x80\x99']
# The two firsts are blank spaces and the last one is a quote

# I didn't know how to continue from here, so I have to wait until the contest was over
# and I read the solutions from https://rsilnav.github.io/posts/challenge-13/. Credits to Rafael Sillero!

# With that info, we can go to https://330k.github.io/misc_tools/unicode_steganography.html and copy and paste
# the fragment with the special character in the 'Binary in Text Steganography Sample' and 
# We should select only the characters U+200B and U+200C
# We can download the hidden data and if we read it as a text file we have 424815162342666. Nice!
